# Masterthesis-Pro-2044-wbk

This folder contains the master's thesis for the development of the adaptation of a tape like Shell to a figure based on continuous elements with the support of substitute models, to evaluate the change of the mechanical properties of a part to the change in the arrangement of the tape.


### Prerequisites

ABAQUS needs to be installed, which already contains and interprets Python. Install Anaconda to read tables in Excel and be able to make substitute models.


### Installing

Install abaqus and set the work directory where the files that generate the tape are located
```
pip install ABAQUS
```

You have to install Anaconda and run Spyder
```
pip install Anaconda
run Spyder
```

## Running the tests

Enter the function generated by the tape in the Simulation Script, and run the script
```
run script simulation.py
```

Enter the simulation results in Excel, and read them from the results code in the appropriate tab
```
read excel Ergebnisse.xlsx  sheet=Winkel
```

Run the results code to predict the simulation values in the surrogate models
```
smt predict_values   Winkel
```

Evaluate the results of surrogate models and simulation results
```
calculate MSE SSE SSR
```

### Break down into end to end tests

These tests evaluate the change of the mechanical properties of a material reinforced with a Carbon fiber Tape, given the change in the arrangement of the tape
```
angle=10  strain= 300 
```

### Coding style tests

There are two types of variations to generate the tape:
-Inclination angle and measurements from the tape, deviation in X and Y from the center of the base body.
```
dx= 0.0, dy= 0.0, w=15,  l=120
```

-Coordinates that define the outline of the tape.
```
-0.1, -0.1
0.1, -0.1
0.1, 0.1
-0.1, 0.1
```

## Deployment

An example of the development can be seen in the data uploaded in the latest Version of the Thesis

## Required packages

This project depends on the following modules: numpy, pandas, SMT, math, abaqus modules
 
* [ABAQUS](http://www.abaqus.com/) - Software used to run simulations
* [PYTHON](https://www.python.org/) - Programming language used
* [ANACONDA](https://www.anaconda.com/) - Software used to implement surrogate models
